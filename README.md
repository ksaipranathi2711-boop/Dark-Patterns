🛡️ DarkPatternAI – AI-Powered Dark Pattern Detection

DarkPatternAI is an AI-inspired browser extension and web demo that detects dark patterns—deceptive UI/UX designs used by websites to manipulate users into unintended actions such as forced consent, hidden subscriptions, and misleading privacy agreements.

This project focuses on preventive cybersecurity and privacy protection, helping users make informed decisions before being misled.

🚩 Problem Statement

Modern websites increasingly employ dark patterns such as:

Misleading cookie banners

Forced consent dialogs

Hidden unsubscribe options

Subscription traps

Emotional manipulation (urgency, guilt, FOMO)

These deceptive practices often go unnoticed by users and evolve faster than traditional rule-based detection tools.

💡 Proposed Solution

DarkPatternAI uses AI-inspired Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to:

Analyze webpage text in real time

Detect manipulative language patterns

Warn users instantly when a potential dark pattern is found

The solution prioritizes prevention over reaction, improving transparency and user trust.
